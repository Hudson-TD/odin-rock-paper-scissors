The Odin Project: Rock Paper Scissors

# Description

This project demonstrates my ability to use DOM manipulation to dynamically update key values and HTML elements via vanilla Javascript. Fundamentals such as callback functions, conditionals, loops, and built in methods (such as Math.random & Math.floor) were employed to build this webpage. Thank you for taking a look and have a great day!
